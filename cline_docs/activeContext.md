## Recent Changes
- **Fixed UI Layout and Component Issues**:
  - **Map Debug Panel Z-Index Fix**: Resolved issue where Map debug panel buttons were hidden behind the map by adding `zIndex: 1000` to ensure proper layering
  - **Responsive Floating Chat Input**: Implemented fully responsive floating chat input in RecommendationsStage that adjusts position based on sidebar state (`left: isCollapsed ? 'calc(64px + 320px)' : 'calc(280px + 320px)'`) with smooth CSS transitions
  - **Consistent Stage Padding**: Fixed MapStage padding inconsistency by using StageContainer with height overrides to maintain both consistent padding (`theme.spacing(3)`) and full vertical space utilization (`height: 'calc(100vh - 64px)'`)
  - **Floating Input Features**: Added tab-specific visibility, proper width alignment with StreamingChatInterface, Enter-to-send functionality, and auto-chat creation
  - **Sidebar Responsiveness**: Enhanced sidebar collapse/expand behavior with proper component repositioning and smooth transitions
- **Completed Navigation Redesign for Space Efficiency**:
  - **NavigationSidebar Implementation**: Created comprehensive collapsible sidebar with auto-collapse after 10 seconds and timer reset on interaction
  - **Student Name Personalization**: Added student name display in sidebar header
  - **Proper Positioning**: Positioned sidebar below AppBar (64px offset) without overlap
  - **Student Selection Page Handling**: Sidebar completely hidden on student selection page
  - **Stage Order Optimization**: Moved "Exit" to last position in stages list (Student Profile → Interests → Budget → Data Collection → Recommendations → Map → Plan → Exit)
  - **Tab Structure Enhancement**: Restored "Chat & Recommendations" and "Tips & Advice" tabs, added new "Example Questions" tab with comprehensive question examples in 4 categories
  - **Full-Width Layout Implementation**: Updated all stages to use full-width layouts, fixed MapStage width constraints using flexible Box layout pattern
  - **Space Reclamation**: Successfully reclaimed ~140px+ of vertical space by moving horizontal navigation to collapsible sidebar
  - **Fixed Width Constraint Issues**: Identified and resolved the root cause of width constraints in StreamingChatInterface by replacing Grid layout (xs={3}/xs={9}) with flexible Box layout (width: 300px / flex: 1), ensuring all stages now use full available width
  - **Consistent Layout Pattern**: Standardized all stages to use StageContainer pattern with proper full-width CSS overrides
- **Implemented Chat Linking and Collapsed View Functionality**:
  - **Chat Links from Map Pins**: Enhanced MapLocationInfoWindow to show "Related Conversations" section with chat titles, dates, and "View Chat" buttons
  - **Collapsed Chat View**: Implemented auto-detection that switches to collapsed view when answers arrive, with smart grouping of question → thinking → answer cycles
  - **View Mode Toggle**: Added working toggle buttons to switch between "Full View" and "Collapsed View"
  - **Fixed Streaming Termination**: Resolved server hanging issue by ensuring all AI services (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) properly send 'complete' events
  - **Fixed Chat ID Linking**: Eliminated "current-chat" placeholder by updating all AI services to receive and use actual chat IDs in analysis prompts
  - **Enhanced MCP Server**: Added `sourceChats` field to MapLocation interface for proper chat linking
  - **Improved User Experience**: Map pins now contain valuable context linking back to conversations, chat interface automatically presents clean Q&A format
- **Enhanced get_cds_data function performance** by adding fuzzy search capability:
  - Added new `search_cds_data` function to the college-data-server MCP
  - Implemented sophisticated fuzzy matching algorithm with Levenshtein distance
  - Added the function to backend tool configurations and prompts
  - AI models can now search for colleges with partial names (e.g., "Harvard", "MIT") before calling get_cds_data
  - This should dramatically improve success rate when models guess college names
