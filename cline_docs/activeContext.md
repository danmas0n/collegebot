# Active Development Context

## Current Task
Fixed map locations not appearing in the frontend by:
1. Corrected collection name mismatch between Firestore service ('map-locations') and migration script ('map_locations')
2. Updated MapLocation type in firestore.ts to include metadata field to match actual data structure
3. Updated migration script to properly handle metadata field when migrating locations
4. Removed student-data MCP server references since map locations are now handled by Firestore

## Recent Changes
- Updated backend/src/config/mcp-tools.ts to remove student-data related tools
- Updated backend/src/services/firestore.ts to use correct collection name and handle metadata
- Updated backend/src/types/firestore.ts to include metadata field in MapLocation type
- Updated migration script to properly handle metadata when migrating locations
- Removed student-data server from MCP settings
- Fixed authentication in map location routes by removing adminMiddleware requirement

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing map functionality with the updated changes
2. Monitor for any potential issues with map location operations
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for map location operations
4. Consider adding validation for metadata field structure
